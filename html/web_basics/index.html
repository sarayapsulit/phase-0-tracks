           <h2> How to train a dog to sit</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Show your dog a small bite-sized treat to grab his attention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Push down his hind legs to be in a sitting postion then say "<strong>sit</strong>".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give him the treat. He should associate this action with as a good thing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Say sit again when your dog sits, give him the treat and tell him what a good doggy he is. (Prasise him without petting him.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Practice making him sit five times a day for five days in a row.
                </li>
