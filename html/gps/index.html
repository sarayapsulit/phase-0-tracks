#What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
#
# I think they organize and section code to be more readable for others to understand. I see as header, footer, section and aside the tags I'll use a lot in future
#
#What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
#
# From top to bottom
#
#What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
#
#I learned that you could create shortcuts-sort of like autocorrect on the phone- with sublime. I will definitely use or make more of them in the future esp for more repeative code
#
#What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
#
#I guess it would differentiating certain semantic tags that are very familiar in use. I would just have to research more. when Deciding how to name parts or sections of my code.
