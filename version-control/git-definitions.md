# Git Definitions

Edit: Hi 

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version Control is like a time line that allows us to see the past edits of one or more files and projects as well as merges done by others working on the project. It allows you to protect software incase there was a mistake. With version control, you can go back to a version that didn't have the error yet.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of your project that you can work on seperately and freely without having to worry about it affecting your original project. You'd use one to add a seperate feature or even more then switch between the master and branches as you'd like to work on them. You could merge all of it, once finished.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point. It's a record when you've made changes to your file or files in the project that comes with a a message that describe what was done during the change. A good message would have specific and precise details on the changes that were made. It should be easy to understand for other people to read. Also it is usually written in present tense.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflit happens when you merge 2 branches then they compete for the same line of a file or when a file sometimes gets deleted and someone else is still editing in that file.
